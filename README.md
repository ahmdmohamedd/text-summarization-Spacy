# Text Summarization with spaCy

This project implements an extractive text summarization model using the spaCy library. The aim is to efficiently summarize large texts, making the information more digestible and accessible.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes a dataset of news articles, processes the text to remove noise, and then applies extractive summarization techniques to highlight key points. The summarization process is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of spaCy in natural language processing (NLP).

## Features

- Text preprocessing to clean and normalize input data.
- Extractive summarization using spaCyâ€™s NLP capabilities.
- Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook (`text_summarization.ipynb`) for running the summarization model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- spaCy
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/text-summarization-Spacy.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd text-summarization-Spacy
   ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `text_summarization.ipynb` and run the cells to process and summarize the text.

## Example

An example of a text summarization using the model can be found in the notebook. Simply run the provided code blocks to see how the summarization works on sample text.
